# Urban Heat Island Analysis in Accra

This project explores the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Accra, Ghana, using Landsat satellite imagery and geospatial analysis.

## Objectives
- Assess spatial patterns of urban heat in Accra.
- Identify hotspots and their relation to land use/land cover.
- Demonstrate how remote sensing and GIS can support urban planning.

## Data Sources
- Landsat 8 (Thermal Infrared Sensor) from USGS Earth Explorer.
- Population and land use data from Ghana Statistical Service (GSS).

## Tools & Methods
- QGIS 3.30 for spatial preprocessing and map production.
- Python (geopandas, rasterio, matplotlib) for data analysis.
- ArcGIS Pro for visualization and hotspot mapping.

## Results
- Accraâ€™s central areas show significantly higher surface temperatures.
- Peripheral green zones mitigate urban heat.
- Produced thematic maps for UHI distribution.
